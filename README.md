Welcome to Kashi's Mobile Lead Form App
=======================================

Hi, 

I am Kashif Ahmed a.k.a. Kashi, a Salesforce Evangelist. This mobile app is built on Salesforce.com platform using Visual Force Page, jQuery, HTML, and CSS for the submission to Mobile Developer Challenge 2013. 
<br>
This app submission is to participate in the Salesforce 2013 Mobile Developer Challenge. Thus, I thought I'd put together a small mobile lead form submission app in a single org so it's convenient for you to try as well.
<br>
I have also added the instructions on how you can make it a public site to bypass authentication for lead submission, as Visual Force page requires you to sign in. However, in reality if you have a contact form for prospect on your site, you don't want them to sign in, as they will not have any login information. Therefore, having setup a public site and have your url forward to this site, helps you capture the lead from anyone on any device. 

NOTE: this is for competition purposes only, is offered as is without warranty.  Do not install into a production org.  (Seriously: go get a [free Dev Org](http://developer.force.com/join).)
