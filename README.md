Welcome to Kashi's Mobile Lead Form App
=======================================

This is my first Mobile App on Salesforce.com platform using Visual Force Page, jQuery, HTML, and CSS for the submission to Mobile Developer Challenge 2013. 
I wanted to participate in the Mobile Developer Challenge and it was hard to come up with something in last two days. 
Thus, I thought I'd put everything together a small mobile lead form submission app in a single org so it's convenient for you to try as well.
I have also added the instructions on how you can make it a public site to bypass authentication for lead submission, as Visual Force page requires you to sign in. 
However, in reality if you have a contact form for prospect on your site, you don't want them to sign in, as they will not have any login information. 
Therefore, having setup a public site and have your url forward to this site, helps you capture the lead from anyone on any device. 

NOTE: this is for competition purposes only, is offered as is without warranty.  Do not install into a production org.  (Seriously: go get a [free Dev Org](http://developer.force.com/join).)

[Install into a dev org from this unmanaged package.](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04tU0000000Ua1n)

If you have an example you'd like to see (or contribute), go for it.
